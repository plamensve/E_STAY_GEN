# eStayGen v1.0

**XML Generator for the Bulgarian NRA (Electronic Transport Declarations for Stay - ETDS)**

`E_STAY_GEN` is a desktop Python application with a graphical interface that automatically generates XML files in compliance with the requirements of the Bulgarian National Revenue Agency (NRA) for stationary transport vehicles carrying fuel.
